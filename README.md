(Just kidding - I only hack my own servers... probably).

# 🖥️ My System Specs:
- **OS:** Human.exe (mostly stable)
- **Shell:** Bash with delusions of grandeur
- **CPU:** 1 brain @ 3.6GHz (overclocked with 🍺 beer)
- **RAM:** 16GB (8GB dedicated to remembering VIM commands)
- **Storage:** 1TB SSD (90% full with memes and config files)

# 🔧 Current Mission Objectives:
1. Keep servers alive (despite users' best efforts)
2. Automate all the things with Python
3. Accidentally create Skynet while "just testing something"
4. Take over the world (optional stretch goal)

⚠️ Warning: My code may contain:
- Sarcastic comments
- Questionable life choices
